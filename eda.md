# EDA Plan

Since the dataset is not yet available, this EDA plan is based on the project requirements and expected KPIs.

---

## 1. Data Overview
- Understand the data structure: number of tables, key relationships
- Check data quality: missing values, outliers, duplicates, inconsistent types
- Generate summary statistics to assess completeness

**Figure 1: Data Quality Check - Missing Values by Field**  
[Description: Bar chart showing the percentage of missing values in key data fields (e.g., "Income Level," "Placement Date," "Home Visits," "Last Contact Date").]

---

## 2. Demographics and Client Trends
**Metrics:** Gender, income, race, ethnicity, age distributions

**EDA Focus:**
- Calculate descriptive statistics
- Create histograms and pie charts for demographic breakdowns
- Explore differences across groups (e.g., income by race or gender)

**Figure 2: Gender Distribution**  
[Description: Pie chart showing the percentage breakdown of clients by gender.]

**Figure 3: Income Level Distribution**  
[Description: Bar chart displaying the count of households by income category (Very Low, Low, Moderate).]

**Figure 4: Race/Ethnicity Breakdown**  
[Description: Horizontal bar chart showing client distribution across different racial/ethnic groups.]



---

## 3. Housing Trends Over Time
**Metric:** Households housed per month

**EDA Focus:**
- Use time series plots to detect seasonal patterns
- Evaluate if housing demand changes across different periods

**Figure 5: Monthly Housing Placement Trends**  
[Description: Time series line chart showing households housed per month with a trend line to identify seasonal patterns.]

**Figure 6: Housing Success Rate Over Time**  
[Description: Line chart displaying the monthly housing success rate (housed/intake %) with moving average.]

---

## 4. Staff Performance Tracking
**Metrics:** Task completion rate, service hours, interventions

**EDA Focus:**
- Compare staff performance using bar charts and boxplots
- Identify outliers and improvement opportunities

**Figure 7: Staff Performance Rankings**  
[Description: Horizontal bar chart showing total interventions or home visits per staff member, sorted from highest to lowest.]

**Figure 8: Task Completion Rate by Staff**  
[Description: Boxplot comparing task completion rates across staff members, highlighting outliers.]

---

## 5. At-Risk Client Identification
**Risk indicators:** Days since last contact, missed appointments, overdue follow-ups

**EDA Focus:**
- Identify risk thresholds (e.g., >30 days without follow-up)
- Visualize distribution of risk indicators


**Figure 9: At-Risk Households Summary**  
[Description: Color-coded card or table showing counts of households in different risk categories (high risk: >30 days, medium risk: 15-30 days, low risk: <15 days).]

# Unexpected Challenges or Risks to Project Success

1.  **Data Availability/API Delays:** The greatest unforeseen risk is that the **actual availability** of data from the **Bonterra Apricot API** may be later than the expected $\mathbf{10/10}$.
2. **Data Quality Challenges:** Excessively high missing rates in critical $[demographic/income]$ fields may render certain designed KPIs **inaccurate to compute**.
