# EDA Plan

Since the dataset is not yet available, this EDA plan is based on the project requirements and expected KPIs.

---

## 1. Data Overview
- Understand the data structure: number of tables, key relationships
- Check data quality: missing values, outliers, duplicates, inconsistent types
- Generate summary statistics to assess completeness

## 2. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
**Metrics:** Total households intake, households housed, housing success rate

**EDA Focus:**
- Visualize data structure and key indicator distributions
- Analyze trends over time using line charts

## 3. Demographics and Client Trends
**Metrics:** Gender, income, race, ethnicity, age distributions

**EDA Focus:**
- Calculate descriptive statistics
- Create histograms and pie charts for demographic breakdowns
- Explore differences across groups (e.g., income by race or gender)

## 4. Weekly Resource Utilization
**Metrics:** Home visits, staff hours, client interactions

**EDA Focus:**
- Identify weekly/monthly activity patterns
- Examine workload distribution among staff

## 5. Housing Trends Over Time
**Metric:** Households housed per month

**EDA Focus:**
- Use time series plots to detect seasonal patterns
- Evaluate if housing demand changes across different periods

## 6. Staff Performance Tracking
**Metrics:** Task completion rate, service hours, interventions

**EDA Focus:**
- Compare staff performance using bar charts and boxplots
- Identify outliers and improvement opportunities

## 7. At-Risk Client Identification
**Risk indicators:** Days since last contact, missed appointments, overdue follow-ups

**EDA Focus:**
- Identify risk thresholds (e.g., >30 days without follow-up)
- Visualize distribution of risk indicators

## 8. Geographic Visualization
**EDA Focus:**
- Map household placements and home visit locations
- Assess geographic patterns and regional concentration
- Explore relationships between location and outcomes
