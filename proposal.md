Housing Impact Dashboard

# Story

We're building a dashboard that lets QHC leaders see what's happening in real-time—how many families they're serving, what help people need most, and how staff are doing—all at a glance, empowering them to make data-driven decisions and respond quickly to emerging needs.

# Data
## Describe
We will use an API data extract from QHC's new Bonterra Apricot case management system, which contains household intake, housing placement, and demographic data for roughly 400-500 client records over two years.

## Link / Risks
The data will be available via API after QHC's go-live date (target 10/10). The primary risk is a project delay if the Apricot system implementation is postponed, potentially impacting the full-term course timeline.
