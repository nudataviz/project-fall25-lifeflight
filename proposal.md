# Data
## Describe
We will use an API data extract from QHC's new Bonterra Apricot case management system, which contains household intake, housing placement, and demographic data for roughly 400-500 client records over two years.

## Link / Risks
The data will be available via API after QHC's go-live date (target 10/10). The primary risk is a project delay if the Apricot system implementation is postponed, potentially impacting the full-term course timeline.
